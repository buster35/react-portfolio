# React Portfolio

![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/license/buster35/react-portfolio)

## Description

The driving force behind this (ongoing) project portfolio is to try to follow that "best-foot-forward" mentality by creating a single-page React app that highlights my various JavaScript projects.
I built this project to provide additional material for potential job recruiters and/or clients in the form of completed/ongoing personal coding projects in JavaScript.
Hopefully this page will provide additional clarity in my abilities, and my desire to improve on previously-completed projects.
I learned a great deal of React by working on this portfolio. A project like this is a great starting point in the world of React because it doesn't require a whole lot of experience to build the components and stateful variables for the portfolio. It was fun though!

## Contributions

No outside collaborators were involved on this project.

The third-party assets used on this project include Node.js, React-Bootstrap for styling, and the React dev platform itself.
Much of the styling for this portfolio was created using React-Bootstrap and therefore I owe a lot to the Bootstrap docs for providing a guiding light through the CSS world.

## Tests

User testing for functionality was used on this project, as well as utilization of a linter during the build process.
